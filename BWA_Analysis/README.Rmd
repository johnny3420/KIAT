All the mapped reads were extracted from the BWA sam files.
From there the reads were split between unique and multimapped reads
Once split, those files were condensed down to only ID, mapQ, and CIGAR string.
Due to large file sizes, after looking at overall mapQ, smaller sample sizes were used.
When looking at CIGAR scores of 0 mapQ reads, only 5000000 random reads from each condition were used.
